# DACS
DACS is an output-neutral set of rules for describing archives, personal papers, and manuscript collections, and can be applied to all material types. DACS is compatible with ISAD(G): General International Standard Archival Description, 2nd ed. (International Council on Archives, 1999) and ISAAR(CPF): International Standard Archival Authority Records for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families, 2nd ed. (International Council on Archives, 2003).

[DACS is available on github](https://github.com/saa-ts-dacs/dacs "DACS GitHub Repository")

# DACS Workshop

In 2015-2016, TS-DACS made a significant change to the format of the [DACS workshop](http://www2.archivists.org/prof-education/course-catalog/describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs "SAA DACS Workshop Webpage") taught by the Society of American Archivists. A series of videos was produced to teach the informational content, which are available free online for anyone who is interested. Workshop participants must watch the videos and pass a quiz for each video prior to attending the workshop. The in-person workshop is then able to focus on putting the standard into practice. This repository holds the most up-to-date versions of the PowerPoint slides and scripts used to produce the videos.
